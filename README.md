| 1 | USB Full Speed  (USB1 P4) | USB Type-C port that supports USB 2.0 Full-speed data rate. It can be used as the power supply interface for the development board and as a communication interface. |
| 2 | USB High Speed  (USB P4) | The USB 2.0 Type-C Port is connected to the USB 2.0 OTG High-Speed interface of ESP32-P4, compliant with the USB 2.0 specification. When communicating with other devices via this port, ESP32-P4 acts as a USB device connecting to a USB host. Please note that USB 2.0 Type-C Port and USB 2.0 Type-A Port cannot be used simultaneously. USB 2.0 Type-C Port can also be used for powering the board. |
| 3 | USB from UART0 P4 | USB Serial/JTAG Port. USB Type-C port that supports USB 2.0 Full-speed data rate. It can be used to flash firmware to the ESP32-P4 chip, communicate with the chip via the USB protocol, and perform JTAG debugging. |
| 4 | CN2 (UART0  P4) | It can be used to flash firmware to the ESP32-P4 chip, communicate with the chip via the UART protocol, and perform JTAG debugging. |
| 7 | ESP32-C6 | This module serves as the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth communication module for the board. |
| 8 | Speaker connector | This port is used to connect a speaker. The maximum output power can drive a 4 Ω, 3 W speaker. |
| 9 | Microphone | Onboard microphone connected to the interface of Audio Codec Chip. |
